Download Visual Studio 2015 Community [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs).
Select the "Custom" installation type and select the following from the features list to install:

- C#/.NET (Xamarin v4.0.3)
- Universal Windows App Development Tools
- Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.0/8.1 Tools

We also recommend installing [Microsoft Visual Studio Emulator for Android](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/features/msft-android-emulator-vs.aspx) as well as [Emulators for Windows Phone 8.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44574). If you already have Visual Studio 2015 installed, you can verify that these features are installed by modifying the Visual Studio 2015 installation via the Control Panel.
